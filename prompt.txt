wygeneruj komendy ffmpeg do wycięcia fragmentów utworów 
każdy fragment ma zawierać dwie linijki np. od 6.65 do 12.76

plik źródłowy kiss.mp3 output kiss1.mp3 kiss2.mp3 itd.

UWAGA trzeba jeszcze wygenerować inserty bo bazy danych

np.
INSERT INTO fragments (filename,tekst) values(kiss1.mp3,"I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits")

Wartość dla kolumny tekst niech jest w cudzysłowach

Jesteś w stanie sobie z tym poradzić?
